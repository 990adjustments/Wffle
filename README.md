Waffle
======

Description
-----------

Sometimes you need to create a loop from a source that has no loop
point and the only way to create the loop is to dissolve between a
duplicate of the source. If the source has transparency, it becomes
a problem.

Waffle is a simple After Effects script that uses the blend effect to create a
seamless loop of your source even with transparency. Can you easily
create the process by hand? Of course you can, this just automates it!

Installation & Usage
--------------------

Just place the script in your After Effects scripts directory.
The script is also dockable so you can place the script in
the After Effects ScriptUI folder.

If the layer you want to loop is the only layer in the comp, just enter
the loop point in seconds and an optional dissolve time and you are good
to good. If you leave the dissolve value blank, it defaults to 1.5 seconds.

If you have multiple layers in your composition, then you need to select
a layer to run the script.
