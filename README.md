Waffle
======
**1.0 for After Effects**

Welcome
-------

Sometimes you need to create a loop from a source that has no loop
point and the only way to create the loop is to dissolve between a
duplicate of the source. If the source has transparency, it becomes
a problem.

Waffle is a simple After Effects script that uses the blend effect to create a
seamless loop of your source even with transparency. Can you easily
create the process by hand? Of course you can, this just automates it!

Installation
------------

Just place the script in your After Effects scripts directory.
The script is also dockable so you can place the script in
the After Effects ScriptUI folder.

How do I use Waffle
-------------------

If you only have one layer in your comp:

 * Enter the point at which you want the loop to begin in seconds
 * Optionally, enter a dissolve value. Default is 1.5 seconds if left blank
 * Loop it!

If you have multiple layers in the comp:

 * You must first select the layer you want to loop
 * Enter the point at which you want the loop to begin in seconds
 * Optionally, enter a dissolve value. Default is 1.5 seconds if left blank
 * Loop it!
