Waffle
======

Description
-----------

Sometimes you need to create a loop from a source that has no loop
point and the only way is to dissolve between a duplicate of the
source you want to loop. If the source has transparency, it becomes
a problem.

Waffle is a simple script that uses the blend effect to create a
seamless loop of your source even with transparency. Can you easily
create the process by hand? Of course you can, this just automates it!

Installation & Usage
--------------------

Just place the script in your After Effects scripts directory.
The script is also dockable so you can place the script in
the After Effects ScriptUI folder.

Take your final source comp or footage item and place it in a
comp. The source file you want to loop should be the only item
in the composition. Run Waffle and then just enter a loop point
and the amount of time between the dissolve and you are good to go!
